/**

 * here rather than declaring their own copy, because two copies is exactly what
 * this replaces. Seven wire fields had ended up declared on one side only —
 * `actualSessionId`, `exitCode` and `parentToolUseId` on the client, and
 * `isCancelledError`, `memoryCitations`, `reason` and `toolUseResult` on the
 * server — with an index signature covering the gap so nothing ever failed to
 * compile. A field that is not declared here is not on the wire.
 *
 * Kept free of both `node:*` and DOM/React imports so either build can include
 * it; both tsconfigs already have the repository root `shared/` on their include
 * path. Each side adds its own local extensions on top (see the re-export sites
 * in `server/shared/types.ts` and `src/shared/types.ts`) — those additions are
 * deliberately visible rather than blended into the wire shape.
